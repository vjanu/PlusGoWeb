                Traffic congestion is a major concern, which has drawn the attention of society. The major problem is the number 
                of vehicles daily entering the urban areas a high. Most of the time, many vehicles are coming from the same area 
                to defined destinations resulting in the vehicles are underutilized. To this end, this study proposes a solution 
                to minimize this problem by implementing a ride-sharing platform: +Go. An initial study of the +Go platform is 
                basically targeting the office staff in Sri Lanka because the majority of the offices are operating in highly 
                congested urban areas. +Go ride-sharing platform matches the profiles of the passengers to the
                drivers, and vice versa, then suggests the rides using trajectory details, gender preference, personal interests, 
                profession, rating, time and date as the parameters. Furthermore, the +Go
                platform uses computer vision methodologies to avoid fake registrations, and nonetheless, it uses crowdsourcing 
                platforms to increase the accuracy of the suggested routes. The passengers, including the driver, have to share 
                the cost for the trip and that is intelligently calculated according to fuel consumption of the vehicle, distance, 
                the time taken to arrive at the destination, which is taken as the parameters for it. Further, to improve the 
                experience of the user, the +Go system maintains a rating system which allows the driver to rate the ride with 
                the passenger, and the passenger to rate on the driver, vehicle and the co-passengers.

                From the survey we conducted with around 150 professionals, we identified most of the professional think 
                ridesharing can reduce traffic congestion(72.5%) and save their fuel cost(68.3%). It is clear that 
                ridesharing can be used as a solution to minimize traffic congestion in Sri Lanka, where they suggest 
                more reasons like reduce environment pollution, save car ownership costs and to meet interesting people, 
                they opt to use ridesharing.

              <br>
              <p align="justify">Furthermore, more than 61% of the professionals like to collaborate with the ridesharing platform, which 
                  is a significantly higher amount. Therefore, we decided to develop a new app using the ridesharing concept. 
                  To do that, we associated many pieces of literature related to the field to identify the possible technologies
                   and algorithms that can be used for the development process.

            <p align="justify">
                    Hence, we considered the gender preference of the professionals while using a ride-sharing platform. Most of 
                    the professionals were having no issue with gender, and they like to travel with either male or female (63.3%).  
                    As well, some people only want to go with a particular gender. Precisely, 11.7% only with the female, and 9.2% only 
                    with the male, etc. Therefore, by considering this fact, we decided to provide gender preference to our application 
                    users during the registration, where they can select whatever the gender preference they like.

                      <p align="justify">Our application only focused on professionals and no other ride-sharing application use this concept. 
                          Also, existing solutions in Sri Lanka, suggest any driver to a passenger, and we have taken a step forward 
                          in making a new advanced method to suggest drivers who match with the job profile, and the preferences of 
                          the passengers. This reduces the number of dissatisfactions from the point of both the driver and the passenger. 
                          Another important factor to be mentioned is that our application has the option for a passenger's guardian or 
                          spouse to track the trip history of the fellow passenger and report any driver whom they think suspicious, and
                           those drivers won't be suggested that passenger again. Out of all the features introduced in UPM, only UDIO has 
                           the feature to enable and disable the gender preference, and it is taken as a measure to ensure security on the
                         point of the user.

                        Validating the user by NIC and license will reduce the fake registrations, and this will eliminate manual 
                            validations in the system. Our application allows users to write their own reviews at the end of the trip, 
                            those sentiments get analyzed using a machine learning algorithm and a proper rating will be given to that 
                            sentiment. Hence, our solution maintains separate ratings for the user’s behavior and vehicle. At the end of 
                            the journey, users can rate the driver, vehicle and the co-passengers separately. Also, the passengers are 
                            given the choice of blocking the drivers so that they won't be suggested in future sessions.

                        According to the statistics from the Road Development Authority, there is the number of private vehicles
                         entering the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) is increasing over the past three decades. Due to that reason, 
                         traffic congestions are increasing as well as the number of accidents are increasing. As a result of the
                          traffic congestion, people are getting delay to reach their destinations, increased fuel wastage and
                           monetary losses. That impacted the whole development process; hence, the government has been lost 
                           over Rs.500 million daily.

                           <br>

                        To reduce traffic congestion, people need public transportation instead of the private 
                        vehicle because of the huge number of crowds travel at once. There are some issues in Public 
                        Transportation, such as not comfortable because it is overcrowded, too expensive if we get on 
                        air-conditioned buses and so on. Therefore, we thought of introducing a ride-sharing app, which
                         could become a <strong>solution to traffic congestion</strong>. The basic idea behind that was to combine professionals
                          who are traveling to work by their private vehicles. The ability to reduce the number of vehicles using 
                          the ride-sharing application because of one vehicle carries several people together.

                             information like gender preference, smoking condition, like quietness, motion sickness, language preference,
                              vehicle comfortability, and profession for that. After receiving that information, the new ride-matching 
                              algorithm was developed using rule-based machine learning and K-Means clustering. In the algorithm, it 
                              is needed to get the current location of the driver, and for that polling, the technique was implemented 
                              where every 5 seconds, the current position of the users were recorded in the database. Also, a new algorithm 
                              was developed to find the reported drivers based on the actions taken by the spouse or the guardian and removed 
                              them from the suggested list. Implemented the OTP system for the mobile number verification of the users to

                                To achieve this, the system has to detect some keywords, which were selected by the users regarding 
                                their experiences in the ride-sharing. Further, this system classifies the reviews given by the users 
                                by using a sentiment analysis algorithm (Naïve Bayes). A feature of blocking drivers also have given for 
                                the passengers to provide the freedom to filter the suggestions of our application. Hence, this component 
                                does help to ensure the security of the passengers and drivers as well.

                                closest path with the least traffic, which connects source and destination while minimizing the traffic 
                                congestion. Dijkstra Algorithm finds the shortest path by considering the weight of the edges in a weighted

                                the applicable conditions in it. Since we enable the registered users to enter the live updates by uploading 
                                images, it will be more helpful to implement crowdsourcing to predict the most efficient route.

                               Colombo area. Statistics like manufacturer year, engine capacity were collected during the survey.

                            In optimum path recognition, we use both Dijkstra's Algorithm and the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) algorithm to 
                            identify the closest path with the least traffic. Because of that, it helps to minimize traffic congestion in urban areas. 
                            Dijkstra's Algorithm provides the optimal path to reach the destination by considering the weight of the edges. According 
                            to the user's concern, the weight of the graph gets vary. If the user's concern is the distance factor, the length of the 
                            edges will be identified as the weight. Similarly, if the user's concern is about traffic, accidents or road closures, weight
                             becomes the calculated time duration to cover the specified distance. Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) Algorithm provides the 
                             optimal path to travel through a city, which covers all the user-specified locations. When users set their locations, our supposed 
                             system will identify the order of the locations to visit. Then this algorithm finds the optimal path, which travels, through each 
                             location (node) in the listed user-specified locations.

                            <p align="justify">Intelligent Complementary Ride-Sharing System, which
                                has been enriched with several machine learning and image
                                processing techniques, has proven that the results are
                                produced with more distinguished accuracy in the context of
                                ride-sharing, and implement a better explanations for its
                                users as a mechanism to diminish the traffic congestion in
                                the country. The principal context of the application; ride
                                matching algorithm has proven with analysis outcomes for
                                its high precision. Moreover, the algorithms such as
                                K-Means Clustering, Rule-based Machine Learning, Naive
                                Bayes Algorithm, Multiple Linear Regression, Dijkstra's
                                Algorithm and Travelling Salesman Problem Algorithm
                                used in the application have made it evident that +Go
                                ride-sharing platform betters other existing applications in
                                the market. Hence, this application will be resulting in
                                reducing the traffic congestion occurs in the urban areas of
                                the country with greater outcomes.
